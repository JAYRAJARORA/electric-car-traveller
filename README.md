Electric Car Traveler

Description : 

Electric cars needs periodic charge as they do not have large range/capacity as gas cars. Assume that you have a long way to go and can't finish it on one charge; you'll need to stop, recharge, and then keep going. However, some of the chargers might not work, in which case you would need to return to the first city and recharge there. The algorithm takes three parameters(Capacity C, no of cities n, distance between cities) and results list 'L' of the cities where one reaches final destination with minimum length among all possible list of cities and stop and charge the car if ran out of the charging.
